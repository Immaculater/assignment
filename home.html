  <p>Developer and Accountant</p>
  <p>currently based in Nigeria.</p>
  <p>my name is Bayero Immaculater, studied accounting at university of jos. i am currently
  a code plateau 3.0 fellow, the journey so far is interesting and challengig. its
interesting because i have learnt a lot of new things, like creating a basic website,
amongst others.</p>
<p>its also challengig because, this whole software engeneering stuf is totally a new thing to
me and i sometimes don't understand the grammer even outside my comfort zone. 
i am still learning so, i should be able to get things done in the future.</p>
